## Background: Why malaria testing matters

Despite being both preventable and treatable, malaria remains one of the leading causes of death among young children worldwide. In 2022 alone, over 600,000 malaria deaths were reported globally, most of them in sub-Saharan Africa. 

Early and accurate diagnosis is **critical**: <span class="highlight">it enables timely treatment, reduces transmission, and saves lives</span>. Yet, access to malaria testing remains deeply **uneven**, particularly in low-income, rural, or conflict-affected areas.

## Introduction

<div class="intro-box">
Millions of children develop fever symptoms every year, but in many parts of the world, they‚Äôre not even tested. This report analyzes the global landscape of malaria diagnostics, uncovering <strong>invisible barriers that silently put lives at risk</strong>.
</div>

 
Drawing on UNICEF Indicator 1: **_‚ÄúPercentage of febrile children under age 5 who had a finger or heel stick for malaria testing‚Äù_**, this analysis covers  multiple countries from 2009 to 2023.

Through a combination of visualisations and narrative, the following sections _explore testing trends, reveal disparities in diagnostic access, and assess how testing efforts match the burden of malaria_.

The world map provides a geographical overview of the _percentage of febrile children under 5 who received a malaria test_ in each country, based on data from the year **2021**. 

It highlights substantial geographic disparities in test coverage:
 **West and Central Africa countries** report the highest testing rates, often **exceeding 60%**, reflecting that malaria remains a major public health issue.
In contrast, **South Asia**, particularly India, shows a testing rate **below 15%**, despite its large population and high malaria burden.
**Southeast Asia and parts of East Africa** appear to be underrepresented or missing, largely due to unavailability rather than absence of malaria risk.

_Selecting 2021 as the reference year aligns with UNICEF's most recent complete dataset and allows for direct comparison with disease incidence levels and COVID-19 impacts._

>_This visualization highlights both <span class="highlight">the presence and the gaps in malaria testing coverage across regions, revealing massive disparities in data availability and healthcare access</span>._

## Evolution of malaria testing over time (2009‚Äì2023)

Beyond geography, it's important to understand how testing rates have evolved over time.

```{python}
import polars as pl
import pandas as pd
from plotnine import *

df = pl.read_csv("unicef_indicator_1.csv")

df_clean = df.select(["country", "indicator", "time_period", "obs_value"])

media_annuale = (
    df_clean
    .group_by("time_period")
    .agg(pl.col("obs_value").mean().alias("avg_tested"))
    .sort("time_period")
    .to_pandas()
)

(
    ggplot(media_annuale, aes(x="time_period", y="avg_tested")) +
    geom_line(color="#d73027", size=1.2) +
    geom_point(color="black", size=2) +
    labs(
        title="Evolution of malaria testing over time (2009‚Äì2023)",
        x="Year",
        y="% of febrile children tested"
    ) +

    )
)

```

This chart shows the **evolution of malaria testing among febrile children under 5 from 2009 to 2023**, based on available country data.

The trend reveals an **overall upward trend**: <span class="highlight">from around **20% in 2009** to nearly **28.7% in 2023**. The spike in **2020** (**over 41%**) likely reflects intensified healthcare efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic</span>.

However, the **progress appears to have slowed**, with values **_fluctuating and even declining_** in some years. This suggests that gains achieved during the pandemic may not have been sustained, especially in regions with **weaker healthcare infrastructure**.

While the previous bar chart highlighted regional differences in average testing rates, this multi-panel line chart tracks _**how** malaria testing rates **have evolved over time** across each major region_.

- **East and West Africa** show consistent improvement across the years, suggesting a **positive response** to global health initiatives.
- **South Asia and Southeast Asia** display **less consistent progress**, with relatively flat or fluctuating trends, possibly reflecting **_persistent barriers to diagnostic access_**, particularly in rural or underserved communities.

While each region follows its own pattern, the overall insight is clear: <span class="highlight">some areas are progressing rapidly, while others require further investment and support</span>.

> Note:_Some regional lines end before the final available year due to limited data availability in recent years. This reflects the **challenges of data collection in regions with weaker infrastructure or political instability**._

##  Which country led in malaria testing from 2019 to 2023?

After observing the overall trend, it is essential to zoom in and understand **which countries are leading the response**. 

The following chart shows the _**top 10 countries** with the highest average percentage of febrile children under age 5 who were tested for malaria between **2019 and 2023**._

This helps to <span class="highlight">call attention to where **diagnostic access is strongest**, and which healthcare systems are more capable of responding to early symptoms</span>.

## Correlation between malaria incidence and testing rates (2021)

The scatter plot below explores the potential relationship between disease burden and diagnostic access, providing insights into whether <span class="highlight">higher malaria incidence leads to larger testing coverage</span>. 
_The analysis is based on the available data for 10 countries in 2021 that report both malaria incidence and diagnostic coverage._

```{python}

import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

import polars as pl
import pandas as pd
from plotnine import *

df_merged = pl.read_csv("merged_unicef_1_&_incidence_of_malaria.csv")

df_scatter = (
    df_merged
    .filter(pl.col("time_period") == 2021)
    .select(["country", "obs_value_malaria_testing", "malaria_incidence"])
    .drop_nulls()
    .to_pandas()
)

The graph shows a **weak but positive correlation**. 

- **Burkina Faso** stands out with a high malaria incidence and the highest testing rate (**over 65%**).
- On the other hand, countries such as **Nigeria and Mauritania** present high incidence but relatively low testing rates, suggesting gaps in healthcare accessibility.
- **India**, despite its large population and significant malaria burden, shows low diagnostic coverage, confirming challenges in reaching remote populations with adequate healthcare services.

The **trend line** suggests that while _higher malaria incidence may encourage greater testing, this is not universally true:_ **several high-incidence countries still lag behind in diagnostic coverage**.

This indicate that other factors, such as <span class="highlight">**healthcare infrastructure, funding, or political will**, may strongly influence testing access beyond disease burden alone</span>.

## <span class="section-title">Key takeaways</span>

<div class="card p-3 bg-light shadow-sm mb-3">
  Some regions, particularly **South and Southeast Asia**, still struggle to achieve adequate levels of testing coverage, while other areas, such as **West and East Africa**, exhibit stronger levels.
</div>

<div class="card p-3 bg-light shadow-sm mb-3">
  Malaria incidence and testing are positively correlated, yet many high-burden nations are <strong> still not</strong> testing sufficiently.
</div>

<div class="card p-3 bg-light shadow-sm mb-3">
  Research indicates that when political will, infrastructure, and investment are in alignment, progress becomes <strong>possible</strong>.
</div>


## <span class="section-title">What can be done</span>

The data is clear: despite advancements in certain areas, millions of children continue to be denied access to a simple test that might save their lives. In order to **bridge this gap**, coordinated actions must be taken: 

- **Equip frontline health workers** with rapid diagnostic kits and continuous training  
- **Monitor and share testing coverage data** by district to identify underserved zones  
- **Streamline access** to malaria testing to improve diagnosis rates and outcomes


## Conclusion

This report has brought attention to a critical, _yet frequently overlooked_, stage in the fight against malaria: testing febrile children under five. Some countries are making strong progress, but in the <span class="highlight">vast majority of regions febrile children are still not being tested</span>. 

The reason may vary; it could be _distance, cost, lack of supplies, or training_. However, we are aware of what the numbers indicate: **access to testing is not equal, and that‚Äôs something we can change**. 
Behind every percentage point lies a  child, a  family, and a chance to take prompt action.

<div class="highlight-box">
In the fight against malaria, <strong>access to testing must become universal</strong>. No child should be left without diagnosis, because every test can save a life.
